8. a) Implement the following behavior in a single PHP script Ss17.php: When your script
is called for the first time, a form appears in the browser with the question “Where do the
Guardians of the Galaxy live?” followed by two mutually exclusive radio buttons “DC
Universe” and “Marvel Universe”, and a button “send answer”. If then the right answer
(Marvel!) is chosen and sent, only the word “Correct” appears. For the wrong answer, the
word “Wrong!” is displayed, followed by a link “try again”. Clicking on that link will
lead back to the form.
